what is CancellationTokenSource in .NET?

**CancellationTokenSource** is a class in the .NET framework that is used to create and manage CancellationToken objects. These objects are used to signal that a task or operation should be cancelled. The CancellationTokenSource class provides methods for creating new tokens, as well as methods for signaling that a cancellation has been requested. Once a cancellation has been requested, any code that is executing and is checking the status of the token will be informed that a cancellation has been requested and can respond accordingly.

Here is an example of how to use the CancellationTokenSource class to cancel a task:


``` C#
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a new CancellationTokenSource
        CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

        // Start a new task that will be cancelled
        Task task = Task.Run(() => {
            while (!cts.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                Console.Write("*");
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
            cts.Token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        }, cts.Token); // Pass the token to the task

        // Wait for the user to press a key
        Console.ReadKey();

        // Request cancellation
        cts.Cancel();

        // Wait for the task to complete
        try
        {
            task.Wait();
        }
        catch (AggregateException e)
        {
            // This is expected when the task is cancelled
            e.Handle(x => x is OperationCanceledException);
            Console.WriteLine("Task was cancelled");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, a new CancellationTokenSource object is created and a new task is started that runs a loop that writes an asterisk to the console every second. The task is passed the CancellationToken created by the CancellationTokenSource. The task checks the status of the token in the loop and if the token has been cancelled the task will throw a OperationCanceledException. In the main thread, the program waits for the user to press a key and then calls the Cancel method on the CancellationTokenSource to request cancellation. The task is then waited on and the exception is caught if thrown.

It's important to note that CancellationTokenSource must be disposed when it is not needed anymore to avoid memory leak.
