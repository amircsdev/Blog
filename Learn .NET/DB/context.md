# what is context in c#?

In C#, a **context** is an object that represents a connection to a database. It is typically used in the **Entity Framework**, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows developers to interact with a database using C# objects rather than writing raw SQL queries.

The context acts as a bridge between the application and the database, and it is responsible for managing the entities (i.e. C# objects) that are being persisted in the database. It is also responsible for tracking changes to the entities, and for generating and executing the SQL commands needed to persist those changes to the database.

A context class is usually derived from the DbContext class, which is part of the Entity Framework. The context class defines the entities that are being mapped to the database, and it also provides methods for querying and saving the entities.

For example, the following is an example of a context class for a database containing a table of Customers:

``` C#
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=MyDatabase;Trusted_Connection=True;");
    }
}
```

In this example, MyDbContext class is derived from DbContext, and it defines a DbSet property for the Customer entity. The OnConfiguring method is used to configure the connection to the database.

You can use this context class to query and save customers like this:

``` C#
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var customers = context.Customers.ToList();
    // Do something with the customers
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

This code creates a new instance of the context, uses it to query for all customers, do something with them (e.g. update), and then saves the changes to the database.
