# UnitOfWork Pattern

In the context of software development, a **Unit of Work** is a pattern that is used to manage changes to a database. It allows a developer to work with multiple entities as a single transaction, and if any of the entities fail to be persisted, the entire transaction can be **rolled back**. The Unit of Work pattern is typically implemented using a repository pattern, and the implementation can vary depending on the specific ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework being used. In C#, the implementation of a Unit of Work may involve creating a class that wraps the database context and exposes methods for starting and committing a transaction, as well as methods for adding, updating, and deleting entities.

Here's an example of a basic Unit of Work implementation in C# using the Entity Framework as the ORM:

``` C#
public class UnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;
    private bool _disposed;

    public UnitOfWork(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public void BeginTransaction()
    {
        _context.Database.BeginTransaction();
    }

    public void Commit()
    {
        _context.SaveChanges();
        _context.Database.CommitTransaction();
    }

    public void Rollback()
    {
        _context.Database.RollbackTransaction();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (_disposed) return;

        if (disposing)
        {
            _context.Dispose();
        }

        _disposed = true;
    }
}
```

This example defines a UnitOfWork class that takes a DbContext in its constructor. The class has methods for starting a transaction, committing the changes, and rolling back the transaction if necessary. It also implements the IDisposable interface to properly dispose of the DbContext when the UnitOfWork is no longer needed.

To use this UnitOfWork class, you can create an instance of it and call the BeginTransaction() method, then perform any database operations (e.g. Add, Update, Delete) using the DbContext and call Commit() method if all the operations are successful or Rollback() otherwise.

``` C#
using(var unitOfWork = new UnitOfWork(new MyDbContext()))
{
    unitOfWork.BeginTransaction();
    // do your database operations
    unitOfWork.Commit();
}
```

This is a very basic example that could be enhanced in many ways, depending on the requirements of the specific application.
